                    <h4>About me</h4>
                    <span>Since childhood, I dreamed of becoming a programmer.
                             I was always attracted to computers and similar technology, 
                             I always wanted to figure out how everything works there.
                              Therefore, at the end of grade 9, I did not hesitate to enter 
                              the College of Applied Informatics, but much to my regret 
                              I could not decide which developer I wanted to be and the 
                              College didn’t help much, so at the end I couldn’t decide 
                              on the direction I knew everywhere by little, and only after 
                              I served in the army and entered the university I began to move 
                              a little towards the profession of web developer, which brought me to you.</span>

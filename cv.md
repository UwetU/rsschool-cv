3. Since childhood, I dreamed of becoming a programmer. I was always attracted to computers and similar technology, I always wanted to figure out how everything works there. Therefore, at the end of grade 9, I did not hesitate to enter the College of Applied Informatics, but much to my regret I could not decide which developer I wanted to be and the College didn’t help much, so at the end I couldn’t decide on the direction I knew everywhere by little, and only after I served in the army and entered the university I began to move a little towards the profession of web developer, which brought me to you.
4. CSS, HTML, JS (elementary level), PHP(elementary level), C++, C, Swift(elementary level) and development environment Visual Studio Code.
5. Education: college UAT (4 years) and I am currently studying at the USATU in my third year in the specialty of "applied informatics".
